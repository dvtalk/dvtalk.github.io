# Hey there
{: .fs-9 }

This is where I keep my notes, my thoughts, my experiences or anything interesting which I think should belong here. :D

## Who am I
Well, you know I'm a design verification engineer and I've been in this industry for quite a while. It's long enough to make me feel that I should share what I know, but also not enough to say that everything on this site are 100 percent correctly (now that I'm pretty busy with all the things going on in my life, the "sharing" is bit too much >.< ). I work with Systemverilog, uvm everyday and these are what I know the most. However, now and then, I also find myself struggling with formal verification, design, STA timing, =)) and the list goes on with synthesis, ECO logic, and also scripting. Talking about scripting, I have been using csh and perl for a long time before switching to zsh/bash and python recently. And I love vim, gosh, it is the best.

## What you'll find here


### 1. You'll find my notes
{: .lh-0.5}
The only first and now the main reason for me to be on this is for keeping my notes. I usually take notes to keep tracks of things. Things that I feel interested in, things that I wanna try or spend some time.

### 2. You'll find my thoughts
{: .lh-0.5}
Sometimes I just feel like talking about some things.
{: .mx-5}


### 3. And you'll find my randoms
{: .lh-0.5}
Let's just say my randoms are just a bit better organized piece of my notes.

OK, that's it mates.
Use the search box if you need anything.
And if you cannot find what you need, well, later then. :D
