## Getting started

### Who I am
Well, you know I'm a design verification engineer and I've been in this industry for quite a while. It's long enough to make me feel that I should share what I know, but also not enough to say that everything on this site are 100 percent correctly. I work with Systemverilog, uvm everyday and these are what I know the most. However, now and then, I also find myself struggling with formal verification, design, STA timing, =)) and the list goes on with synthesis, ECO logic, and also scripting. Talking about scripting, I have been using csh and perl for a long time before switching to zsh/bash and python recently. And I love vim, gosh, it is the best.
