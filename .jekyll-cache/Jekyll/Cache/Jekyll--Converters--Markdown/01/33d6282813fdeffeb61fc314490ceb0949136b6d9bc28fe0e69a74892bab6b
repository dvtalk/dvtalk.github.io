<p class="fs-5 fw-500">Iâ€™ve been using vcs and questasim for verification for a while, and both of these tools allow us to interact with the simulator using their cli.
We can use them for debugging, create checking point, restore simulation, â€¦ .
But mostly for my case, I use this cli for forcing signals.
And this method help me in many situations such as creating some error cases (for testing purspose), or forcing signals from the logic that has not been implements yet.
Letâ€™s go through some examples for forcing signals using Questasim (or another version of this eda tool is ModelSim).</p>
