# How to use uvm_event and uvm_event_pool
Systemverilog already has `event`, used for communication. However if using uvm, my opinion is we should use `uvm_event` instead.
It's a class, so we can easily to manage the event in oop style. And thanks to that, `uvm_event_pool` is created to support us.

## uvm_event vs Systemverilog event
My opinion is, always use the uvm_event, because it can many advatages over the Systemverilog event:
1. Supporting more functions, easier to control the event and also easier to remember.
For example, given the event named `func_done`, trigger the event with `func_done.trigger()` is much more clear than `->func_done`.
1. Allowing passing data with the event.
1. Having callback function, which will be run before and after the event is triggered.
1. Having `uvm_event_pool`, which is very convinience.

## How to use uvm_event and uvm_event_pool

### uvm_event class basic function
The macro will actually create a typedef of type_id as below:
{% highlight verilog %}
class l2_layer extends uvm_object;
   `uvm_object_utils(l2_layer)

   ...
endclass
{% endhighlight %}

### uvm_event with data object

### uvm_event callbacks
