# How to use uvm_event and uvm_event_pool
Systemverilog already has `event`, used for communication. However if using uvm, my opinion is we should use `uvm_event` instead.
ut's a class, so we can easily to manage the event in oop style. And thanks to that, `uvm_event_pool` is created to support us.

## uvm_event vs Systemverilog event
* Class scope resolution operator `::`.
1. More supported function, easier to control the event.
1. Allow passing data with the event.
1. Can have callback function, which will be run before and after the event is triggered.
1. Can be used with uvm_event_pool, which is very convinience

### uvm_event class basic function
The macro will actually create a typedef of type_id as below:

class l2_layer extends uvm_object;
   `uvm_object_utils(l2_layer)

   ...
endclass
{% endhighlight %}
